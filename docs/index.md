# About

WebЯcade consists of an intuitive [web-based front end](./userguide/index.md) (the webЯcade player) that enables playing popular gaming content entirely within the context of the browser across a [wide variety of platforms](./apps/../platforms/index.md) (Xbox Series X|S, iOS, Android, Windows, macOS). Gamepads are supported (Bluetooth and USB) for both front-end navigation and while playing games.

The content for playing games (binaries, etc.) and populating the front-end (images, etc.) is collected from [cloud-based resources](./feeds/resources/index.md) based on [user-defined feeds](./feeds/index.md). Each feed item (game, etc.) has an associated application type. [Application types](./apps/index.md) include [emulators](./apps/emulators/index.md) (Atari, Sega, Nintendo) and [game engines](./apps/engines/index.md) (Classic Doom).

The following lists further describe webЯcade in terms of its focus.

Primary focus:

* Runs entirely within the web browser leveraging JavaScript, WebAssembly, and the HTML5 gamepad and audio interfaces
* Adaptive user interface that supports a [wide variety of platforms](./apps/../platforms/index.md) (Xbox Series X|S, iOS, Android, Windows, macOS)
* Native gamepad support (Bluetooth and USB) for both front-end navigation and while playing games
* [User-defined feeds](./feeds/index.md) (cloud-based or local) identify the resources (images, etc.) required to populate the front-end as well as the content (binaries, etc.) required to play games
* Each feed item (game, etc.) has an associated application type. [Application types](./apps/index.md) include [emulators](./apps/emulators/index.md) (Atari, Sega, Nintendo) and [game engines](./apps/engines/index.md) (Classic Doom). The quantity and types of applications will continue to expand over time.

Not focused on:

* Directly playing locally stored game content (ROMs, etc.)<br>*(Technically possible by using a local web server, but not a primary use case)*
* The "latest and greatest" emulator features and compatibility<br>*(Primary emphasis is on compatibility with popular game content across a variety of platforms while minimizing resource requirements)*
* Touch-based (virtual) gamepad controls<br>*(The focus is on native gamepad support via Bluetooth and USB)*

## Getting Started

The following steps are recommended for getting started with webЯcade:

* Review the [User Guide](./userguide/index.md) in order to familiarize yourself with the webЯcade player (front-end).
* Read the documentation for the [Platform](./platforms/index.md) (OS, device) you will be using with webЯcade to learn platform-specific details such as how to optimize the experience and how to connect gamepads.
* Review the documentation for each [Application](./apps/index.md) that is launched to determine its keyboard and gamepad mappings as well as any other application-specific notes (an application is the emulator or engine being used to play a particular game, etc.).
