## Documentation

The [webЯcade Documentation](https://docs.webrcade.com/) consists of a [User Guide](https://docs.webrcade.com/userguide/), instructions specific to each [Platform](https://docs.webrcade.com/platforms/) (OS, devices) supported by webЯcade, detailed information (button mappings, etc.) for the various [Application Types](https://docs.webrcade.com/apps/) (emulators, etc.), and guidance for developing your own [Feeds](https://docs.webrcade.com/feeds/).

The following steps are recommended for getting started with webЯcade:

* Review the [User Guide](https://docs.webrcade.com/userguide/) in order to familiarize yourself with the webЯcade front-end.
* Read the documentation for the [Platform](https://docs.webrcade.com/platforms/) (OS, device) you will be using with webЯcade to learn platform-specific details such as how to optimize the experience and how to connect gamepads.
* Review the documentation for each [Application](https://docs.webrcade.com/apps/) that is launched to determine its keyboard and gamepad mappings as well as any other application-specific notes (an application is the emulator or engine being used to play a particular game, etc.).
